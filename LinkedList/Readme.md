### ✅ **Progression Advice**

1. **Start with Easy** → basic traversal, insertion, deletion.
2. **Move to Medium** → pointer tricks like middle node, palindrome, merging.
3. **Hard/Advanced** → reverse in groups, cycle detection, linked list as number problems, circular linked list problems.
4. **Optional Challenges** → multi-list merge, Josephus, complex pointer manipulation.
